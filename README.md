# Machine Learning Minor Project

## Introduction
This is a minor project developed as part of my academic coursework to understand the practical implementation of Machine Learning concepts.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts
[output] based on given input features. The project focuses on understanding
data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.


## Dataset
 FIFA Player Dataset – Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets 

The objective of this project is to analyze football player performance using Exploratory Data 
Analysis techniques. The project aims to identify important factors that influence a player’s 
overall rating and understand relationships between different player attributes such as age, 
potential, and skill ratings. 
The problem can be defined as: 
“Given a dataset containing football player attributes, perform exploratory analysis to 
uncover patterns, correlations, and insights related to player performance.”

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Algorithms Used
- [Algorithm 1]
- [Algorithm 2] (if any)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- 1. FIFA Player Dataset – Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets 
2. Pandas Documentation – https://pandas.pydata.org 
3. Seaborn Documentation – https://seaborn.pydata.org

## Results
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted on the FIFA player dataset using Python libraries 
such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
Key observations from the analysis include: 
• Age Distribution: Most professional football players fall within the age range of 20
30 years, indicating the peak performance age group. 
• Overall Rating Distribution: The majority of players have average overall ratings, 
while only a small number of elite players possess very high ratings. 
• Age vs Overall Rating: Players generally reach peak performance in their mid-20s, 
after which the overall rating gradually declines. 
• Correlation Analysis: Strong positive correlations were observed between overall 
rating and attributes such as potential, passing, dribbling, and shooting. 
• Position-wise Analysis: Certain positions tend to have higher average overall ratings 
depending on skill requirements. 
The visualizations clearly highlight how technical skills and physical attributes influence a 
player’s performance

## Conclusion
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with data handling and machine learning workflows.
This project successfully performed Exploratory Data Analysis on football player data to 
understand performance-related patterns. EDA helped identify key factors affecting player 
ratings and revealed meaningful relationships among player attributes. 
The analysis demonstrates that player performance is strongly influenced by technical skills, 
potential, and age. Such insights can be useful for football analysts, coaches, and clubs when 
evaluating players.
